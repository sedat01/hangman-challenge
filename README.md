## Description
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hangman is game where a random word is choosen and the player has to guess the word.
The player has limited amount of bad guesses a.k.a lives. The classic version involves drawing hanged man. Every mistake 
leads to drawing a part of the sketch until the drawing is completed (game over) or the word is guessed (player wins).
In this version however we play only in the terminal and thus ommit the drawing and track the errors with numeric score.
By default the Player starts with 5 lives, but this can be changed in the source code of the game

## Installation
